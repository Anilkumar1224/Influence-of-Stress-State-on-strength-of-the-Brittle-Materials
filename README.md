# Influence of the Stress State on the Strength of Brittle Materials

This repository presents the work conducted for my Master's Thesis at the University of Bremen, focused on understanding the failure behavior of brittle ceramics under different stress states using triaxial testing methods.

## 📘 Summary

Ceramics with high strength and low weight are ideal for lightweight structural applications. However, their widespread use is limited by their unpredictable failure under multiaxial stress conditions. This project investigates the deformation and fracture behavior of alumina–mullite ceramic composites using a custom-developed triaxial testing setup.

Key contributions:
- Redesign and calibration of a triaxial test apparatus to reliably apply axial and confining loads.
- Synthesis of ceramic specimens using freeze casting and sintering at different temperatures (1100 °C and 1300 °C).
- Mechanical testing under uniaxial and triaxial conditions.
- Analysis of the effect of confining pressure on fracture behavior and compressive strength.

## 🧪 Experimental Methods

- **Material**: Alumina–Mullite composites  
- **Fabrication**: Freeze casting, followed by sintering at two temperature levels  
- **Testing**:
  - Uniaxial compression tests
  - Triaxial tests with independent axial and radial load application
  - Porosity measurement using water intrusion method

## 🔍 Key Findings

- The new triaxial testing approach successfully applied confined stress, overcoming earlier design issues.
- Porosity and sintering temperature significantly influenced compressive strength.
- Triaxial stress states led to **higher compressive strengths** by reducing crack propagation.
- Batch 1 (sintered at 1100 °C) showed **lower porosity and higher strength** compared to Batch 2.


## 🚀 Future Work

- Extend testing to other ceramic systems and porous architectures
- Finite element modeling (e.g., in Abaqus) of fracture under confinement
- Correlate microstructural data with mechanical performance
